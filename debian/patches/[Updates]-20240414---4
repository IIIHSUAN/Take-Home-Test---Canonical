+\`configure' configures GNU Hello  to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          @<:@@S|@ac_default_prefix@:>@
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.
+
+Fine tuning of the installation directories:
+  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
+  --sbindir=DIR           system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]

+
+Some influential environment variables:
+  CC          C compiler command
+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
+              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+  CPP         C preprocessor
+
+Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
+it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

+\`configure' configures GNU Hello  to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          @<:@@S|@ac_default_prefix@:>@
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.

+
+Some influential environment variables:
+  CC          C compiler command
+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
+              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+  CPP         C preprocessor
+
+Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
+it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

+\`configure' configures GNU Hello  to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          @<:@@S|@ac_default_prefix@:>@
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.
+
+Fine tuning of the installation directories:

+  --with-libintl-prefix[=DIR]  search for libintl in DIR/include and DIR/lib
+  --without-libintl-prefix     don't search for libintl in includedir and libdir
+
+Some influential environment variables:
+  CC          C compiler command
+  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
+  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
+              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
+  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
+  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
+              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
+  CPP         C preprocessor
+
+Use these variables to override the choices made by `configure' or to help
+it to find libraries and programs with nonstandard names/locations.

+   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
+   <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.
+
+   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
+   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for 'inline void f
+   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }', c99 incorrectly complains
+   'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function'.
+   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.
+
+   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
+   on configurations that mistakenly use 'static inline' to implement
+   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
+   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
+   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
+   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
+   from calling static functions.  This bug is known to occur on:
+
+     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html
+
+     DragonFly; see
+     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/bleeding-edge-potential/latest-per-pkg/ah-tty-0.3.12.log
+
+     FreeBSD; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html
+
+   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
+   for clang but remains for g++; see <http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.

+   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see

+
+   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
+   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for \'inline void f
+   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }\', c99 incorrectly complains
+   \'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function\'.
+   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.
+
+   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
+   on configurations that mistakenly use \'static inline\' to implement
+   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
+   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
+   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
+   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
+   from calling static functions.  This bug is known to occur on:
+
+     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html
+
+     DragonFly; see
+     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/bleeding-edge-potential/latest-per-pkg/ah-tty-0.3.12.log
+
+     FreeBSD; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html
+
+   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
+   for clang but remains for g++; see <http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.

+   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
+   <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.
+
+   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
+   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for \'inline void f
+   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }\', c99 incorrectly complains
+   \'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function\'.
+   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.
+
+   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
+   on configurations that mistakenly use \'static inline\' to implement
+   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
+   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
+   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
+   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
+   from calling static functions.  This bug is known to occur on:
+
+     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html
+
+     DragonFly; see
+     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/bleeding-edge-potential/latest-per-pkg/ah-tty-0.3.12.log
+
+     FreeBSD; see:
+     http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html
+
+   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
+   for clang but remains for g++; see <http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
+   Assume DragonFly and FreeBSD will be similar.  */

+dnl Sets the variables LIBTHREAD and LTLIBTHREAD to the linker options for use

+dnl libtool).
+dnl Sets the variables LIBMULTITHREAD and LTLIBMULTITHREAD similarly, for
+dnl programs that really need multithread functionality. The difference
+dnl between LIBTHREAD and LIBMULTITHREAD is that on platforms supporting weak
+dnl symbols, typically LIBTHREAD="" whereas LIBMULTITHREAD="-lpthread".
